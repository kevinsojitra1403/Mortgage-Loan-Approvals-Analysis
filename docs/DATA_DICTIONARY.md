## Data Relationships

### Primary Relationships
\`\`\`
mortgage_applications.Application_Date â†’ dim_date.Application_Date (Many-to-One)
mortgage_applications.Province â†’ dim_province.Province (Many-to-One)
mortgage_applications.Property_Type â†’ dim_property_type.Property_Type (Many-to-One)

monthly_summary.Province â†’ dim_province.Province (Many-to-One)
monthly_summary.Property_Type â†’ dim_property_type.Property_Type (Many-to-One)
\`\`\`

### Relationship Cardinality
- **One-to-Many**: Each dimension record can relate to multiple fact records
- **Referential Integrity**: All foreign keys have corresponding dimension records
- **No Orphaned Records**: All fact table foreign keys are valid

---

## Business Rules

### Data Quality Standards
- **Completeness**: No NULL values in required fields
- **Accuracy**: All calculated fields verified against source formulas
- **Consistency**: Standardized formats across all tables
- **Timeliness**: Data represents applications from 2020-2024

### Calculation Rules
\`\`\`sql
LTV_Ratio = (Mortgage_Value / Property_Value) * 100
Down_Payment = Property_Value - Mortgage_Value
Approval_Rate = (Approved_Applications / Total_Applications) * 100
\`\`\`

### Business Constraints
- **LTV Ratio**: Maximum 95% (Canadian mortgage regulations)
- **Minimum Down Payment**: 5% for properties under $500K, 10% for $500K+
- **Credit Score**: Minimum 600 for approval consideration
- **Debt Service Ratios**: Implicit in approval decisions

### Data Validation Rules
- Property_Value > Mortgage_Value (positive down payment)
- LTV_Ratio between 50% and 95%
- Credit_Score between 500 and 850
- Interest_Rate only populated for approved applications
- Application_Date within valid business date range

## Usage Notes

### Power BI Implementation
- Use dim_date as the primary date table
- Create relationships in Power BI model view
- Mark dim_date as date table for time intelligence
- Use monthly_summary for performance-optimized visuals

### Performance Considerations
- Index on Application_Date for time-based queries
- Use monthly_summary for aggregate visualizations
- Implement proper star schema relationships
- Consider partitioning by year for large datasets

### Data Refresh Strategy
- Full refresh recommended for dimension tables
- Incremental refresh possible for fact tables by Application_Date
- Monthly_summary should be recalculated after fact table updates
